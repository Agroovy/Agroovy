I'm Agroovy. Reach me at agroovy.github@gmail.com.

The project I'm most proud of is [Morshian](https://morshian.github.io). 
It's inspired from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Rj9mHj79E) video of an RTX Morshu.
I was taking a coding course, and our final project was to make a full webpage about anything we wanted.
I had the Morshu meme in my head and ran away with it.
The idea is that Morshu is immortal and runs a very powerful corporation.
I really just used his face and didn't think and Zelda lore at all.
Looking at the final webpage, I gotta say I love how I got the navbar to slide in and out.
